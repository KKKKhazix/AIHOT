// In-doubt work. A stopped process leaves "pending" receipts and deliveries: they become
// "unknown" and are never re-sent on their own. An unknown receipt is released once automatically after
// half an hour without checking the provider's bill, so a lost answer costs at most one repeat; one that
// turns unknown again waits for an authorized manual release with the actual billing state and a note. A released
// receipt lets its request call again, and an article that stopped on it goes back to processing.
// A primary already handed to a backup is retained for billing; only the backup may need recovery.
